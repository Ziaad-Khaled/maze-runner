The objective of the project is to implement a themed maze runner game where the player navigates through a maze, avoiding obstacles and collecting coins.

## Project Guidelines

### Gameplay Description

The main character runs through the maze, encountering two types of obstacles that need to be avoided by jumping over them. Additionally, there are coins that the player needs to collect. The placement of obstacles and coins should be random. Sound effects should occur for every action taken by the player.

The player can move using specific keys on the keyboard and can look to their left or right direction using mouse movements or mouse keys. The game provides both a first-person and third-person perspective camera. The player can switch between the cameras using a designated key on the keyboard.

The obstacles, player character, and coins should have textures applied to them. The player character follows a predefined path in the maze, jumping to avoid obstacles and turning to follow the maze paths. The player's score increases the longer they stay in the game and receives rewards for avoiding obstacles or collecting coins.

Once the player reaches the end gate of a level, they are granted access to a new maze with a different environment (Level 2). The project should include two themed environments, and each team can choose their preferred theme.

### Game Features

1. Navigation through the game is done using keyboard and mouse functions.
2. Implementation of obstacle avoidance or collision detection for obstacles is done.
3. Animations for user interactions (e.g., collecting objects, colliding with obstacles) are generated.
4. There are two different scenes (levels) with distinct environments.
5. The player's score is displayed on the screen.
6. Camera is navigated using keyboard and/or mouse functions, including first-person and third-person perspectives.

### Movement

#### Keyboard Controls

- **W**: Move forward.
- **S**: Move backward.
- **A**: Strafe left.
- **D**: Strafe right.
- **Spacebar**: Jump.
- **P**: Switch between first-person and third-person perspectives.

#### Mouse Controls

- Use the mouse to look around and change the camera view.

The player can navigate through the maze using these keyboard and mouse controls. Use the W, S, A, and D keys for movement, the spacebar for jumping, and P to toggle between the camera perspectives. You can also look around using your mouse to change your view.

Feel free to customize and expand upon these controls as needed for your game.
